Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze marketing campaign data to understand customer behavior, segment customers for targeted marketing, and predict the success of future campaigns. Using Python and various data analysis and machine learning libraries, we will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation using clustering, and predictive modeling. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset is publicly available here.

Project Steps
Data Collection

Load the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle missing values and duplicate records.
Convert data types if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform descriptive statistics.
Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them.
Analyze customer demographics and campaign responses.
Customer Segmentation

Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their behavior and demographics.
Visualize the clusters and interpret the results.
Predictive Modeling

Build a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict the success of future marketing campaigns.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Results and Insights

Summarize the key findings from the analysis.
Provide actionable insights for improving marketing strategies.
